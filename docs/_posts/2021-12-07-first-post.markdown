Today I made this website and this post.   
It uses Jekyll to generate the static site using markdown.

This is an example of Jekyll's powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
