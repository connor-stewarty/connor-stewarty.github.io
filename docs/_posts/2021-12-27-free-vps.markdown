Today I made two virtual private servers using [Oracle Cloud's][Oracle] free tier. 
The free tier comes with AMD processors, 1GB RAM, and 200 total storage to use between them. 
This is pretty impressive compared to other free offerings from Google, AWS, or Azure. 

I plan to use them for personal programming projects, such as this post that was created on the VPS. One specific project I would like to create on one of the VPS is my own VPN.
