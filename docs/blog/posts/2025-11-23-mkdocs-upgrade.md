# MkDocs Upgrade

Today I upgraded by blog to use [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) after noticing many projects use it, including [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) which is a recently tool I've started using for dependency management. 

I also connected the GitHub Pages site to use my `connorstewarty.com` domain.

I am looking forward to writing more posts regarding new things I've been learning recently such as Pixi, Rancher, and Grafana.
